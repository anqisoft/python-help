NAME
    runpy - runpy.py - locating and running Python code using the module namespace

MODULE REFERENCE
    https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/runpy
    
    The following documentation is automatically generated from the Python
    source files.  It may be incomplete, incorrect or include features that
    are considered implementation detail and may vary between Python
    implementations.  When in doubt, consult the module reference at the
    location listed above.

DESCRIPTION
    Provides support for locating and running Python scripts using the Python
    module namespace instead of the native filesystem.
    
    This allows Python code to play nicely with non-filesystem based PEP 302
    importers when locating support scripts as well as when importing modules.

FUNCTIONS
    run_module(mod_name, init_globals=None, run_name=None, alter_sys=False)
        Execute a module's code without importing it.
        
        mod_name -- an absolute module name or package name.
        
        Optional arguments:
        init_globals -- dictionary used to pre-populate the module’s
        globals dictionary before the code is executed.
        
        run_name -- if not None, this will be used for setting __name__;
        otherwise, __name__ will be set to mod_name + '__main__' if the
        named module is a package and to just mod_name otherwise.
        
        alter_sys -- if True, sys.argv[0] is updated with the value of
        __file__ and sys.modules[__name__] is updated with a temporary
        module object for the module being executed. Both are
        restored to their original values before the function returns.
        
        Returns the resulting module globals dictionary.
    
    run_path(path_name, init_globals=None, run_name=None)
        Execute code located at the specified filesystem location.
        
        path_name -- filesystem location of a Python script, zipfile,
        or directory containing a top level __main__.py script.
        
        Optional arguments:
        init_globals -- dictionary used to pre-populate the module’s
        globals dictionary before the code is executed.
        
        run_name -- if not None, this will be used to set __name__;
        otherwise, '<run_path>' will be used for __name__.
        
        Returns the resulting module globals dictionary.
