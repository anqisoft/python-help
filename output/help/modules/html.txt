FUNCTIONS
    escape(s, quote=True)
        Replace special characters "&", "<" and ">" to HTML-safe sequences.
        If the optional flag quote is true (the default), the quotation mark
        characters, both double quote (") and single quote (') characters are also
        translated.
    
    unescape(s)
        Convert all named and numeric character references (e.g. &gt;, &#62;,
        &x3e;) in the string s to the corresponding unicode characters.
        This function uses the rules defined by the HTML 5 standard
        for both valid and invalid character references, and the list of
        HTML 5 named character references defined in html.entities.html5.
