FUNCTIONS
    findmatch(caps, MIMEtype, key='view', filename='/dev/null', plist=[])
        Find a match for a mailcap entry.
        
        Return a tuple containing the command line, and the mailcap entry
        used; (None, None) if no match is found.  This may invoke the
        'test' command of several matching entries before deciding which
        entry to use.
    
    getcaps()
        Return a dictionary containing the mailcap database.
        
        The dictionary maps a MIME type (in all lowercase, e.g. 'text/plain')
        to a list of dictionaries corresponding to mailcap entries.  The list
        collects all the entries for that MIME type from all available mailcap
        files.  Each dictionary contains key-value pairs for that MIME type,
        where the viewing command is stored with the key "view".
