FUNCTIONS
    aix_buildtag()
        Return the platform_tag of the system Python was built on.
    
    aix_platform()
        AIX filesets are identified by four decimal values: V.R.M.F.
        V (version) and R (release) can be retreived using ``uname``
        Since 2007, starting with AIX 5.3 TL7, the M value has been
        included with the fileset bos.rte and represents the Technology
        Level (TL) of AIX. The F (Fix) value also increases, but is not
        relevant for comparing releases and binary compatibility.
        For binary compatibility the so-called builddate is needed.
        Again, the builddate of an AIX release is associated with bos.rte.
        AIX ABI compatibility is described  as guaranteed at: https://www.ibm.com/    support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_aix_72/install/binary_compatability.html
        
        For pep425 purposes the AIX platform tag becomes:
        "aix-{:1x}{:1d}{:02d}-{:04d}-{}".format(v, r, tl, builddate, bitsize)
        e.g., "aix-6107-1415-32" for AIX 6.1 TL7 bd 1415, 32-bit
        and, "aix-6107-1415-64" for AIX 6.1 TL7 bd 1415, 64-bit
