NAME
    posixpath - Common operations on Posix pathnames.

MODULE REFERENCE
    https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/posixpath
    
    The following documentation is automatically generated from the Python
    source files.  It may be incomplete, incorrect or include features that
    are considered implementation detail and may vary between Python
    implementations.  When in doubt, consult the module reference at the
    location listed above.

DESCRIPTION
    Instead of importing this module directly, import os and refer to
    this module as os.path.  The "os.path" name is an alias for this
    module on Posix systems; on other systems (e.g. Windows),
    os.path provides the same operations in a manner specific to that
    platform, and is an alias to another module (e.g. ntpath).
    
    Some of this can actually be useful on non-Posix systems too, e.g.
    for manipulation of the pathname component of URLs.

FUNCTIONS
    abspath(path)
        Return an absolute path.
    
    basename(p)
        Returns the final component of a pathname
    
    commonpath(paths)
        Given a sequence of path names, returns the longest common sub-path.
    
    commonprefix(m)
        Given a list of pathnames, returns the longest common leading component
    
    dirname(p)
        Returns the directory component of a pathname
    
    exists(path)
        Test whether a path exists.  Returns False for broken symbolic links
    
    expanduser(path)
        Expand ~ and ~user constructions.  If user or $HOME is unknown,
        do nothing.
    
    expandvars(path)
        Expand shell variables of form $var and ${var}.  Unknown variables
        are left unchanged.
    
    getatime(filename)
        Return the last access time of a file, reported by os.stat().
    
    getctime(filename)
        Return the metadata change time of a file, reported by os.stat().
    
    getmtime(filename)
        Return the last modification time of a file, reported by os.stat().
    
    getsize(filename)
        Return the size of a file, reported by os.stat().
    
    isabs(s)
        Test whether a path is absolute
    
    isdir(s)
        Return true if the pathname refers to an existing directory.
    
    isfile(path)
        Test whether a path is a regular file
    
    islink(path)
        Test whether a path is a symbolic link
    
    ismount(path)
        Test whether a path is a mount point
    
    join(a, *p)
        Join two or more pathname components, inserting '/' as needed.
        If any component is an absolute path, all previous path components
        will be discarded.  An empty last part will result in a path that
        ends with a separator.
    
    lexists(path)
        Test whether a path exists.  Returns True for broken symbolic links
    
    normcase(s)
        Normalize case of pathname.  Has no effect under Posix
    
    normpath(path)
        Normalize path, eliminating double slashes, etc.
    
    realpath(filename)
        Return the canonical path of the specified filename, eliminating any
        symbolic links encountered in the path.
    
    relpath(path, start=None)
        Return a relative version of a path
    
    samefile(f1, f2)
        Test whether two pathnames reference the same actual file or directory
        
        This is determined by the device number and i-node number and
        raises an exception if an os.stat() call on either pathname fails.
    
    sameopenfile(fp1, fp2)
        Test whether two open file objects reference the same file
    
    samestat(s1, s2)
        Test whether two stat buffers reference the same file
    
    split(p)
        Split a pathname.  Returns tuple "(head, tail)" where "tail" is
        everything after the final slash.  Either part may be empty.
    
    splitdrive(p)
        Split a pathname into drive and path. On Posix, drive is always
        empty.
    
    splitext(p)
        Split the extension from a pathname.
        
        Extension is everything from the last dot to the end, ignoring
        leading dots.  Returns "(root, ext)"; ext may be empty.
