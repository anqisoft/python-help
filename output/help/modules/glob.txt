NAME
    glob - Filename globbing utility.

MODULE REFERENCE

    The following documentation is automatically generated from the Python
    source files.  It may be incomplete, incorrect or include features that
    are considered implementation detail and may vary between Python
    implementations.  When in doubt, consult the module reference at the

FUNCTIONS
    escape(pathname)
        Escape all special characters.
    
    glob(pathname, *, recursive=False)
        Return a list of paths matching a pathname pattern.
        
        The pattern may contain simple shell-style wildcards a la
        fnmatch. However, unlike fnmatch, filenames starting with a
        dot are special cases that are not matched by '*' and '?'
        patterns.
        
        If recursive is true, the pattern '**' will match any files and
        zero or more directories and subdirectories.
    
    iglob(pathname, *, recursive=False)
        Return an iterator which yields the paths matching a pathname pattern.
        
        The pattern may contain simple shell-style wildcards a la
        fnmatch. However, unlike fnmatch, filenames starting with a
        dot are special cases that are not matched by '*' and '?'
        patterns.
