FUNCTIONS
    decode(input, output, header=False)
        Read 'input', apply quoted-printable decoding, and write to 'output'.
        'input' and 'output' are binary file objects.
        If 'header' is true, decode underscore as space (per RFC 1522).
    
    decodestring(s, header=False)
    
    encode(input, output, quotetabs, header=False)
        Read 'input', apply quoted-printable encoding, and write to 'output'.
        
        'input' and 'output' are binary file objects. The 'quotetabs' flag
        indicates whether embedded tabs and spaces should be quoted. Note that
        line-ending tabs and spaces are always encoded, as per RFC 1521.
        The 'header' flag indicates whether we are encoding spaces as _ as per RFC
        1522.
    
    encodestring(s, quotetabs=False, header=False)
