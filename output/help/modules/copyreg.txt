NAME
    copyreg - Helper to provide extensibility for pickle.

MODULE REFERENCE
    https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/copyreg
    
    The following documentation is automatically generated from the Python
    source files.  It may be incomplete, incorrect or include features that
    are considered implementation detail and may vary between Python
    implementations.  When in doubt, consult the module reference at the
    location listed above.

DESCRIPTION
    This is only useful to add pickle support for extension types defined in
    C, not for instances of user-defined classes.

FUNCTIONS
    __newobj__(cls, *args)
    
    __newobj_ex__(cls, args, kwargs)
        Used by pickle protocol 4, instead of __newobj__ to allow classes with
        keyword-only arguments to be pickled correctly.
    
    add_extension(module, name, code)
        Register an extension code.
    
    clear_extension_cache()
    
    constructor(object)
    
    pickle(ob_type, pickle_function, constructor_ob=None)
    
    remove_extension(module, name, code)
        Unregister an extension code.  For testing only.
