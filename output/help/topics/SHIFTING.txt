Shifting operations
*******************

The shifting operations have lower priority than the arithmetic
operations:

   shift_expr ::= a_expr | shift_expr ("<<" | ">>") a_expr

These operators accept integers as arguments.  They shift the first
argument to the left or right by the number of bits given by the
second argument.

This operation can be customized using the special "__lshift__()" and
"__rshift__()" methods.

A right shift by *n* bits is defined as floor division by "pow(2,n)".
A left shift by *n* bits is defined as multiplication with "pow(2,n)".
