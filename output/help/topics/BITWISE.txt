Binary bitwise operations
*************************

Each of the three bitwise operations has a different priority level:

   and_expr ::= shift_expr | and_expr "&" shift_expr
   xor_expr ::= and_expr | xor_expr "^" and_expr
   or_expr  ::= xor_expr | or_expr "|" xor_expr

The "&" operator yields the bitwise AND of its arguments, which must
be integers or one of them must be a custom object overriding
"__and__()" or "__rand__()" special methods.

The "^" operator yields the bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) of its
arguments, which must be integers or one of them must be a custom
object overriding "__xor__()" or "__rxor__()" special methods.

The "|" operator yields the bitwise (inclusive) OR of its arguments,
which must be integers or one of them must be a custom object
overriding "__or__()" or "__ror__()" special methods.
