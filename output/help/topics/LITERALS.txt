Literals
********

Python supports string and bytes literals and various numeric
literals:

   literal ::= stringliteral | bytesliteral
               | integer | floatnumber | imagnumber

Evaluation of a literal yields an object of the given type (string,
bytes, integer, floating point number, complex number) with the given
value.  The value may be approximated in the case of floating point
and imaginary (complex) literals.  See section Literals for details.

All literals correspond to immutable data types, and hence the
object’s identity is less important than its value.  Multiple
evaluations of literals with the same value (either the same
occurrence in the program text or a different occurrence) may obtain
the same object or a different object with the same value.
